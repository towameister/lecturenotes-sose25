# EMSE: Software Patterns
## Lecture 01: Introduction
### Motivation
domain-specific language: terminology/language used in a specific domain (Chess)

Pattern: useful knowledge piece, help to build complex software in the context of frequent change by **reducing complexity** and **isolating change**	
not just design, but other subjects have patterns too

### SE is more than just coding	
- Problem solving activity (understand, propose solution, engineer based on solution using good design)		
- dealing with complexity (abstractions, models, distribution of tasks)		
- dealing with change (requirements, design, impl, testing, deployment, maintenance)

### Patterns: definition and vocabulary
SE knowledge: algorithms + patterns
algorithm: describable in code, list of steps for desired output/solving a problem ("recipe")

pattern: describing generic solutions to recurring problems in certain contexts

- usually natural languge
- usually with text and pictures (UML, Drawings..)
- describes core of solution in a reusable way without doing it in the same way twice (when implementing)
- typically described with a clear name, problem statement, context, structure, dynamics, examples, ...


Pattern language: vocab for understanding ideas behind patters

- rules to combine collection of patterns into architecture


Pattern catalog: collection of related patterns

- typically subdivides patterns into categories, may include referencing between patterns

### SE knowledge
#### first insight: science can help create knowledge
generally via **empirical methods**  
grounded theory: systematic method to generate theory from data
Qualitative  
- can be used to identify patterns


#### second insight: knowledge is falsifiable
- there is no absolute truth when trying to understand reality
- one can only build theories which are true until somebody finds a counter example
- -> falsification: act of disproving a theory/hypothesis
- "based on this data, by out best judgment, using SotA-knowledge"

#### third insight: _Failures are helpful!dd_
- analogy: building bridges, a collapse of a bridge leads to stronger bridges
- _"Success in engineering is defined by its failures"_
- failures yield more information than successes because failures draw more scrutiny, a world without failure is a world of complacency
