# Ethics and Modern AI
## Lecture 1: Introduction & Fundamentals
### Artificial Intelligence:
computational system that acts intelligently

### Four schools of thought (Russel and Norvig)
- Reasoning vs. Acting
- Human-like behavior vs. Rational behavior
- Systems can reason or act, and behave human-like or rationally

### Turing test for AI:
Can a human differentiate, whether or not its talking to another human or a machine? 

### Strong vs. Weak AI (John Searle)
- Weak: limited to single, narrowly defined task
- Strong: "a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds"
- AI research is more concerned with **artificial general intelligence (AGI)**, rather than strong AI

### AGI
_“[…] a software program that can **solve a variety of
complex problems in a variety of different domains**, and
that **controls itself autonomously with its own thoughts,
worries, feelings, strengths, weaknesses, and predisposition**”
Pennachin and Goertzel (2007)_

Is AGI possible?



### Generative AI: 
AI that is able to generate Text/Media

### Beginnings of AI: Rule-based AI
- basically, a million if statements
- tedious

### Modern AI is mainly based on Machine Learning
- Example: Supervised Learning
- Input data -> Training -> Testing -> Model
- Training done in Epochs, Data typically split into training and test sets to validate accuracy (Precision, Recall, F1-Score,...)

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
computational understanding/reasoning/generation of natural language

### Replika/Realistic Chatbots (GPT/Candy.ai)
Systems like that can influence users and harm them (e.g. driving to suicide, substance abuse...)

## Issues with Modern AI

### Fairness & Trust
- Racism, Sexism, and other forms of Discrimination
- Bias from Training data will Bias the output model

### Privacy, Data Protection & Annotation Ethics
- How do we honor the privacy of data subjects when training AI?
- What about Copyright?
- workers are/were exploited to annotate data/make models less toxic, traumatizing work reading shit like that all day for less than 2$/hr
- A new form of Colonialism/exploiting the poorer countries, global power relations persist even in the age of AI which is supposed to deliver good
- 

### Dual Use, Misuse & AI Warfare
- Rise of military AI

### Transparency
- Reasoning of AI is not explained
- No one really knows how the Neural Network infers and arrives at conclusions
- 
### Environmental Aspects
- Rare earth metals & semiconductors, exploitation of hard labor in Africa
- Training AI is costly in all things from energy consumption to material consumption
